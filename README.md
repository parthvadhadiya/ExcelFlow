### Customizing the AI Model

You can change the OpenAI model used by modifying the `model` parameter in `backend/app/agent.py`:

```python
response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",  # Change to your preferred model
    messages=all_messages,
    tools=self.tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
)
